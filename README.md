# Chromatography Peak Analysis App

An interactive **R Shiny application** for visualizing, detecting, and integrating peaks in chromatographic data.  
Upload one or multiple CSV files containing `(time, intensity)` pairs and the app performs smoothing, peak detection, trapezoidal integration, and percentage area calculation.

---

## Features

- **Peak detection**
  - Height-only threshold (% of max signal)
  - Savitzky–Golay smoothing for noise reduction
  - Robust trapezoidal peak integration (pracma::trapz)
  - Automated relative area (%) calculation

- **Visualization**
  - Overlay or separate-panel modes
  - Automatic, balanced viridis color palette
  - Optional base color override
  - Peak labels with optional % areas

- **Export**
  - Summary CSV with peak times and relative areas
  - Plot export as **PNG**, **TIFF**, or **EPS**

- **Demo data** included for quick testing

## Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewvgrassetti/Chromatography.git
cd Chromatography

### Install Dependencies

#Open R an run:

install.packages(c(
  "shiny","bslib","readr","ggplot2","colourpicker","scales",
  "dplyr","purrr","tidyr","stringr","signal","minpack.lm","pracma","viridisLite"
))
# Optional: high-quality graphics
install.packages(c("ragg","Cairo"))

#Alternatively, if using renv:
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()

### Running the App
library(shiny)
shiny::runApp(".")

A browser window will open automatically.
If not, copy the printed URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7428) into your browser.

Input Format

Each chromatogram file must be a 2-column CSV:

time	intensity
0.00	12.3
0.01	12.9
...	...

Time in minutes (or any consistent unit)

Intensity in arbitrary units

Multiple files may be uploaded simultaneously.

Output
Summary CSV

One row per file including:

total number of peaks

per-peak times

per-peak relative area (%)

Plot export

Available formats:

###Testing

Run automated tests:
Rscript scripts/test_chrom.R


Expected output includes checks for:
peak count accuracy
integration correctness
stability with noise


PNG
TIFF
EPS
with adjustable size and DPI.
